//main menu, round, stats
	// state machine - what info does each state need to know, what is the focus of each state
	// what properties does each have?
	// each state as an enter and exit method
		// enter function - set up anything that state needs (first round)
		// exit - clean up anything like event listeners
		// switch state - calls appropriate enter and exit
